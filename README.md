# SAndP-500-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
 This project analyzes the relationship between SAndP 500 prices, interest rates, and employment using multiple linear regression. It includes data visualization with Seaborn, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ². A 3D plot visualizes the regression plane, offering insights into stock price prediction.

**Requirements:** Python 3.12

**Note:** This project was developed using Spyder(6.0.1) from the Anaconda Navigator, which comes with many of these libraries pre-installed. If you're also using Spyder within Anaconda, you may already have most of these packages.

**Important:** Place the CSV file (S&P500_Stock_Data.csv) in the same folder as the Python file (S&P500MultipleLinearRegression.py) so the script can locate it without additional configuration.
